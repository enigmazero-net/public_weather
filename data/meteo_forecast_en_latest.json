  "title": "WEATHER FORECAST FOR 11 JANUARY 2026 Issued at 05.30 a.m. on 11 January 2026 The low pressure area over the Gulf of Mannar is weakening further. Therefore, the influence of this system on the island's weather is further gradually reducing. Several spells of showers will occur in Northern, North-central, Uva, and Eastern provinces. A few showers may occur in the North-western and Central provinces. Showers or thundershowers may occur at a few places elsewhere during evening or night. Misty conditions can be expected at some places in Western, Sabaragamuwa and Central provinces and in Galle and Matara districts during the early hours of the morning. The general public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers.",
